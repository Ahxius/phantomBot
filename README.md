# PHANTOM Bot

Discord Bot created using `discord.py`, which from what I last heard has been deprecated. This bot features calls to Google Sheets API, Roblox API, and others.

It is quite a niche bot and doesn't have many uses other than the server I created it for, but feel free to refer to it if you are looking for a template to create
a Discord bot on. Reach out to me by email at [ahxius@sdf.org](mailto://ahxius@sdf.org) or Discord at _Ahxius_ with any questions.
